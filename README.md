Tweeft
======

Tweeft is an open source Twitter client implementation designed to save time through loading web pages in the background.

1.0 is approved by Apple but still does not show up. It's probably because major update in App Store before the special event on 9/9. I will post more info about how you can contribute to Tweeft and how you can learn iOS dev with it shortly.
