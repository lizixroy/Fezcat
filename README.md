Tweeft
======

People share lots of links on Twitter, the experience has been rendered rather fragmented because everytime you open a page from a link you need to wait for it to load. Tweeft provides extremely smooth tweets browsing experiece by puting web paing loading on the background threads. I use this app everyday and I am delignted by how much it saved me everyday.

There are still lots of things to be done to make it even better. I am plaing to add major update very soon. In the meantime you can take it for a spin on the App Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweeft-swift-twitter-browser/id912519599?mt=8

It's also a good way to learn development for iOS by browsing Tweeft source code.
