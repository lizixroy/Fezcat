Fezcat
======
###What is Fezcat
Many poeple like me use Twitter as a very important source of information. It's how we engage and interprete the world. 

Fezcat set out to make tweets reading process much better by eliminating the need to wait shared pages to load.

###What's next
There are still lots of things to be done to make it even better. I am plaing to add major update very soon. In the meantime you can take it for a spin on the App Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweeft-swift-twitter-browser/id912519599?mt=8

It's also a good way to learn development for iOS by browsing Tweeft source code.
