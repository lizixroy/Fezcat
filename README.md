Fezcat
======

Many poeple like me use Twitter as a very important source of information. It's how we engage and interprete the world.

Fezcat set out to make tweets reading process much better by eliminating the need to wait shared pages to load.

You can find demo videos that show you why it's better at [http://fez.cat][http://fez.cat]

This project is still under development.
